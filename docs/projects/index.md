## Featured Work

### Platform and Deployment

- **[Traefik-Deployment](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/Traefik-Deployment)**  
  Reference implementation for running Traefik on a dedicated host with repeatable bootstrap, update, and troubleshooting scripts. Covers Cloudflare/TLS integration, shared Docker network patterns, and operator runbooks for predictable production deployments.

- **[VitePress-Template](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/VitePress-Template)**  
  Reusable site template with deployment automation, container build/publish workflow, and environment-driven configuration. Includes optional capabilities such as signed private resume links and an embedded assistant API for site-grounded Q&A.

- **[GitHub-MCP-Deployment](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/GitHub-MCP-Deployment)**  
  Deployment workflow focused on standing up and maintaining GitHub MCP server components. Documents compose patterns and operational procedures for reliable service lifecycle management.

### Agent and MCP Systems

- **[Context-Engineering](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/Context-Engineering)**  
  Primary workspace for role-routed agent architecture, context boundaries, and implementation patterns across planning, delivery, and compliance functions.

- **[context-engineering-role-systems-architect](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/context-engineering-role-systems-architect), [context-engineering-role-implementation-specialist](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/context-engineering-role-implementation-specialist), [context-engineering-role-compliance-officer](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/context-engineering-role-compliance-officer), [context-engineering-role-hr-ai-agent-specialist](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/context-engineering-role-hr-ai-agent-specialist)**  
  Role-specific repositories that isolate objectives, constraints, and execution policies by function. This structure keeps agent behavior explicit and auditable while supporting collaboration across specialized domains.

- **[github-issue-email-parser](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/github-issue-email-parser)**  
  Email bridge for GitHub Issues using Microsoft Graph webhooks, token-based thread mapping, and reply parsing. Enables email-first ticket participation while preserving issue history in GitHub.

- **[mcp-auth-broker](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/mcp-auth-broker)**  
  Authentication broker concept for agent token issuance workflows with secret-manager integration. Designed to centralize credential access control and reduce direct secret exposure in automation pipelines.

- **[JoshGPT-MCP](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/JoshGPT-MCP)**  
  MCP server implementation for tool orchestration and supervisor-style integration patterns. Used to evaluate practical control-plane and execution-plane boundaries for real-world agent operations.

### Endpoint and Server Operations

- **[endpoint-tools](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/endpoint-tools)**  
  Consolidated endpoint administration and automation script collection.

- **[server-tools](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/server-tools)**  
  Consolidated server remediation and maintenance scripts.

- **[python-network-tools](https://github.com/joshphillipssr/python-network-tools)**  
  Consolidated network tooling lab projects with preserved history.
