## SUMMARY

IT Systems Engineer and Consultant with 25+ years designing, deploying, and operating secure, resilient infrastructure across private sector, nonprofit, and public-sector environments. Deep technical and operational experience in virtualization, endpoint management (MDM), EDR/SIEM, Microsoft 365 and Azure/Entra ID, routing and switching, and automation.

Recent focus includes architecting and operationalizing AI systems for infrastructure workflows: MCP-based control-plane design, role-routed agent orchestration, local/self-hosted LLM integrations, and governance frameworks that keep AI actions constrained, auditable, and approval-driven.
