# Welcome

This repository is a starter VitePress site template.

Use it to build a docs site, portfolio, or internal knowledge base, then deploy behind Traefik.

## Customize

1. Update `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` for title, description, and navigation.
2. Replace this page with your own homepage content.
3. Update `docs/Resume/index.md` (or remove that section) based on your site goals.
